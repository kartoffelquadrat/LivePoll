Set up CI pipeline, automated checks + shield

Menu bar, or at least home button, that figures on all slides.

For quick poll, set right answer to undefined, to not create solution field. (as i explain on the fly. or at least allow for leaving empty)

Every poll currently has its own URL.
Would make sense to consider packs as a series of URLs? / are initiated once and every poll redirects to next on end?

Load poll pack menuy, should probably only be "packs" menu. Each item should have Load / Export button. There should be an option to add new in the same menu

Update quickpoll / poll create menu, to contain optional solution flag and explanation data.
