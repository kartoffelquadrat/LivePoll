  THIS IS A STUB. In essence here is a file drop menu / browse menu / selection of prepared files found on disk.
  When one pack is selected, JS fires a fetch for every instance, then creates a list with all URLs, and forward to first poll.
  Every poll aver completion removes first item in list, then forwards to next poll.
  When list is empty: stats / back to menu.
